			<h1>Making a decision</h1>
			<div class="inner">
				<p>I know she is there, I know he is there, I know they will meet, they will talk. That makes me very angry, anxious, worried and jealous, especially that she enjoys spending time with him. Who knows what else they plan together? How much time they spend together outside school? Her enjoying his presence is what hurts me the most. But it isn't so unusual, she knows so many people, all with different backgrounds. It's mind-boggling how many people really know her, as a friend or acquaintance. And he is just one of them, I guess. In the end I'm just really jealous of anyone and everyone who spends time with her because I want it to be me.</p>

				<p>She told me that she doesn't view anyone of us more than a friend, but can't those feelings change? for him? I'm trying to change them but she won't budge. Is he able to do it? That would completely shatter my self-esteem. Why would he be enough but not I?</p>

				<p>4 days ago she had her birthday. She told me no one wished her so well and probably never will. Next day she uploaded my cover (of the birthday card I made) and thanked everyone for their wishes. The next two days were quiet. She was in the city and as she told me there she has more fun activities than at her parents (where she also works). In general she has been less sharing, of her work or her whereabouts and doings.</p>

				<p>Yesterday night we had a good conversation and I was so happy. She shared without me asking a picture of her and a lady we talked about. I am happy she is still comfortable with me. She told me about her hearing insecurities. This was the first time she mentioned the word "insecurities", days after I said it a couple days ago on another subject.</p>

				<p>I want her to share with me intimate details. It makes me feel wanted and needed. I feel bad for not having much interesting stuff to share with her.</p>

				<p>I feel sometimes I can be exhausting and silly and that turns her off. But that is just me and partly enjoy this of me. I send things to her or the group conversations that I think they roll their eyes over, like I'm immature. She also thinks I'm not very mature. This may be true at times but I am serious when the situation calls for it.</p>

				<p>I know alot of these things I do can be traced to my family, I see alot of parallels of how I act to others and my family to me.</p>

				<p>Now I'm very sad that she won't tell me how today went without asking. She went to sort some things out I asked her about yesterday. If she doesn't share it on her own, what does it mean? That she doesn't care enough to tell me? We are friends. We talked about it. It has consequences on other things we talk about. If anything important arose from it, would she tell me on her own accord? This will show how she feels about our relationship. If nothing yet important came to be, she may not think it's necessary to share. How will I know what's happening?</p>

				<p>Her silence speaks volumes. I don't know if she even realizes it. I may in the end just be a friend and never more, who she can reach out when she needs something. Like a superficial friend, another tool in her shed she can use.</p>

				<p>Sometimes she can be very silent without letting me know what's going on but rationally speaking that's okay. She lives her very eventful life with so many people and responsibilities, and for her I'm just a very, very tiny part of it. If I just go silent, vanish, everything would be the same for her. I feel like I'm not that important, and never will be.</p>

				<p>Friends will drift away, I would rather be with her forever. It's the  first time I feel so close with someone and the rejection, the lack of reciprocation hurts the most.</p>

				<p>After 11 hours, the first thing she asks me is if I can do something for her, for her social media project. She didn't even tell me she finally created it, she just wants to use me. No update on todays matter, as expected. I know that I act as a doormat sometimes, but that's simply who I am, whether it is for her or anyone else. If someones asks, I help without second thoughts.</p>

				<p>It is so tiring not being seen as a good friend that she cares about. I'm never her first thought in any interpersonal matter. I should really and seriously reconsider how much effort I put into our friendship because I feel it's very onesided and in the end she will move on with no regrets.</p>

				<p>I won't say anything about how I feel, I will just stop contacting her. She wont care and stop too. But she will always think we are on good terms. When I need something from her she will probably do it, that's my only use for her from now on. I'll find someone who appreciates and respects me for who I am.</p>

				<p>I know my actions are erratic again but this time I don't think I'm wrong. Atleast I think so. Even if she still only sees me as a friend she is doing a piss-poor job. I must admit she is more understanding and accepting than any other person I've met, but I believe this only because I'm only superficially in her life. She does not want to commit to a closer relationship, but she also doesn't want me absolutely gone, as I may be useful sometimes. But never once did she ask how I was doing. When I talk about my life she seems so disinterested.</p>

				<p>I think I made peace with the fact that she will never be a romantic partner, but right now what really makes me miserable is that she isn't a good friend at all.</p>

				<p>Before I knew her she was never important. Now that I do, I fear that we drift away. If I was with her so many of my problems would be solved, she seems like the perfect match. But if she continues to be the way she is now I would be miserable. Further proof that I should move on and forget her.</p>
