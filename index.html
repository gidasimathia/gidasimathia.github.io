			<h1>An unexpected event</h1>
			<div class="inner">
				<p>I didn't plan this early today to get into contact, I'am still waiting for the results later this day or tomorrow. But after learning about a strong earthquake I couldn't keep myself from checking in on her. Everyone's fine, that's great.</p>

				<p>I am still troubled on how to approach her. Could I keep in contact without harboring obsession? I go ballistic when i feel she isn't interested in me, in what I have to say or my opinion on something important.</p>

				<p>Going no contact will not help me overcome these feelings, but remove them out of mind out of sight. This is not a solution, but a temporary band-aid on a deep wound.</p>
				
				<p>The problem I have to solve is my obsession over her and my self-esteem. Is she really that amazing? Doesn't she have fatal flaws that will make me disinterested? Can I convince myself she is not the one?</p>
				
				<p class="scene">***</p>
				
				<p>Fuck that noise in my head, also fuck other people. They are never truly honest, they may be to you but they will play other people they don't like to gain something. This is a very ugly trait. I should play this game too, one can go very far this way.  With this in mind, she is not the right person for me, she doesn't appreciate me, I'll take what I can get from her, I'll play her and at the same time look for someone who appreciated me and I can truly be comfortable with. If I am not your first thought, you won't be mine either. Someone someday will be and everything will be made right that day. Until that day I will show her the best version of me, with all the traits that are important to me. I will not play hard to get but I will let her do the approaching from now on. If she values me she will look for my validation. If she doesn't, I'm better off, she will still owe me anyway.</p>
				
				<p>I tried to not become moody, paranoid, and delusional again, but as expected my thoughts and feelings are changing as I write from hopelessness, envy to anger and toxicity. But by no means am I unpleasant to speak with, I am very chill albeit not much forthcoming.</p>
				
				<p>No compulsion, no anxiety, no neediness, no more.</p>
				
				<p class="scene">***</p>
				
				<p>Food is cooking, so I've got a little bit of time, and before I change my mind again I want to tell you, fuck you. You said I should never apologize for my bad mood but that doesn't equal to you reaching out. All these times when we wrote you never once asked me how I am holding up. It was always about you. You you you. We could spend so much time and energy about your life but when it came to mine you were so apathetic. No "why do you feel this way", "why did you make that decision" or "what was on your mind".</p>
				
				<p>You are so silent and I know it's my fault. But you never tell me when something's wrong. You just ignore it and it goes away for you. Then you go to your next victim bleeding them dry. Always trying to reach higher and higher, seeking for a purpose that will fulfill your life, all the while losing your human decency. Friends don't treat firends that way. But I will never be able to tell you that.</p>
				
				<p>We wrote everyday but I always felt so lonely.</p>
				
				<p>Eureka! It's about control, I want control over my life, and also over our relationship, but never over her. I want her to reach her dreams by my side.</p>
				
				<p class="scene">***</p>
				
				<p>Oh I can feel the tension, it feels like something is broken that can't be repaired. This is the first time she complained to the group conversation about her tiring work and not to me in privat. It feels like something pierced my heart. I destroyed something beautiful, her trust in me. It will never be like before. I think I lost her. My hear can't take no more failure. Fuck. I didn't want this. I made a mistake.</p>
				
				<p>There we are again. Mood changed like clockwork. I forget all the things I said before and only focus on getting her attention. Am I immature? indecisive? Do I have low self-esteem ? (yes). Why do I care so much about her opinion and closeness with her? She plays me like a fiddle and I don't know what to do about this.</p>
				
				<p>For what it's worth, I apologized. Atleast I can end today on a good note. Man do I hate myself. Nohing's easy. I can still incite a conversation with her. We good. Forget what I wrote 2 paragraphs above.</p>

			<h1>MIA</h1>
			<div class="inner">
				<p>I decided to quit cold turkey for a couple of days until some important results are out. These will decide if I keep contact or not. It was kind of abrupt, I'm not sure how she will take it. She may be hurt and decide to move on too, she may not resent me for it at all, she is very understanding after all. Or she may not care at all.</p>

				<p>I'm still not sure how much I mean to her. We did chat alot, had some close conversations and she felt very comfortable with me, but how many people are there she talks like this too? Meaning our relationship is not that unique and she won't feel a difference if I'm gone.</p>

				<p>If the last thing is true then so much effort was in vain, it wasn't made to last, atleast for me. In around 2 days I will make a decision, and it's going to be difficult. If it's good news for me, will she want me back? Will our friendship continue as if I didn't just vanish? I'm afraid I hurt her even if she may deny it.</p>
				
				<p>My mental state wasn't too bad today, I was just idling without much joy. Atleast I didn't feel the need to cry and contemplate some more serious things. Nevertheless, breaking off contact will hurt me more than her.</p>

			<h1>Making a decision</h1>
			<div class="inner">
				<p>I know she is there, I know he is there, I know they will meet, they will talk. That makes me very angry, anxious, worried and jealous, especially that she enjoys spending time with him. Who knows what else they plan together? How much time they spend together outside school? Her enjoying his presence is what hurts me the most. But it isn't so unusual, she knows so many people, all with different backgrounds. It's mind-boggling how many people really know her, as a friend or acquaintance. And he is just one of them, I guess. In the end I'm just really jealous of anyone and everyone who spends time with her because I want it to be me.</p>

				<p>She told me that she doesn't view anyone of us more than a friend, but can't those feelings change? for him? I'm trying to change them but she won't budge. Is he able to do it? That would completely shatter my self-esteem. Why would he be enough but not I?</p>

				<p>4 days ago she had her birthday. She told me no one wished her so well and probably never will. Next day she uploaded my cover (of the birthday card I made) and thanked everyone for their wishes. The next two days were quiet. She was in the city and as she told me there she has more fun activities than at her parents (where she also works). In general she has been less sharing, of her work or her whereabouts and doings.</p>

				<p>Yesterday night we had a good conversation and I was so happy. She shared without me asking a picture of her and a lady we talked about. I am happy she is still comfortable with me. She told me about her hearing insecurities. This was the first time she mentioned the word "insecurities", days after I said it a couple days ago on another subject.</p>

				<p>I want her to share with me intimate details. It makes me feel wanted and needed. I feel bad for not having much interesting stuff to share with her.</p>

				<p>I feel sometimes I can be exhausting and silly and that turns her off. But that is just me and partly enjoy this of me. I send things to her or the group conversations that I think they roll their eyes over, like I'm immature. She also thinks I'm not very mature. This may be true at times but I am serious when the situation calls for it.</p>

				<p>I know alot of these things I do can be traced to my family, I see alot of parallels of how I act to others and my family to me.</p>

				<p>Now I'm very sad that she won't tell me how today went without asking. She went to sort some things out I asked her about yesterday. If she doesn't share it on her own, what does it mean? That she doesn't care enough to tell me? We are friends. We talked about it. It has consequences on other things we talk about. If anything important arose from it, would she tell me on her own accord? This will show how she feels about our relationship. If nothing yet important came to be, she may not think it's necessary to share. How will I know what's happening?</p>

				<p>Her silence speaks volumes. I don't know if she even realizes it. I may in the end just be a friend and never more, who she can reach out when she needs something. Like a superficial friend, another tool in her shed she can use.</p>

				<p>Sometimes she can be very silent without letting me know what's going on but rationally speaking that's okay. She lives her very eventful life with so many people and responsibilities, and for her I'm just a very, very tiny part of it. If I just go silent, vanish, everything would be the same for her. I feel like I'm not that important, and never will be.</p>

				<p>Friends will drift away, I would rather be with her forever. It's the  first time I feel so close with someone and the rejection, the lack of reciprocation hurts the most.</p>

				<p>After 11 hours, the first thing she asks me is if I can do something for her, for her social media project. She didn't even tell me she finally created it, she just wants to use me. No update on todays matter, as expected. I know that I act as a doormat sometimes, but that's simply who I am, whether it is for her or anyone else. If someones asks, I help without second thoughts.</p>

				<p>It is so tiring not being seen as a good friend that she cares about. I'm never her first thought in any interpersonal matter. I should really and seriously reconsider how much effort I put into our friendship because I feel it's very onesided and in the end she will move on with no regrets.</p>

				<p>I won't say anything about how I feel, I will just stop contacting her. She wont care and stop too. But she will always think we are on good terms. When I need something from her she will probably do it, that's my only use for her from now on. I'll find someone who appreciates and respects me for who I am.</p>

				<p>I know my actions are erratic again but this time I don't think I'm wrong. Atleast I think so. Even if she still only sees me as a friend she is doing a piss-poor job. I must admit she is more understanding and accepting than any other person I've met, but I believe this only because I'm only superficially in her life. She does not want to commit to a closer relationship, but she also doesn't want me absolutely gone, as I may be useful sometimes. But never once did she ask how I was doing. When I talk about my life she seems so disinterested.</p>

				<p>I think I made peace with the fact that she will never be a romantic partner, but right now what really makes me miserable is that she isn't a good friend at all.</p>

				<p>Before I knew her she was never important. Now that I do, I fear that we drift away. If I was with her so many of my problems would be solved, she seems like the perfect match. But if she continues to be the way she is now I would be miserable. Further proof that I should move on and forget her.</p>
